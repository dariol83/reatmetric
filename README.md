# ReatMetric
ReatMetric is a Java-based software infrastructure for the implementation of Monitoring & Control (M&C) systems, with a
strong focus on the space domain. ReatMetric components provide a simple but efficient implementation of the typical 
functions used in an M&C system.

## System Overview

### Modules
ReatMetric is a modular framework, decomposed in modules following the Java module system mechanism. Each module implements specific functionalities and can be _typically_ be replaced in isolation, if needed. The module definition follows a layered approach:

### Dependencies

## Core Functionalities

### Abstraction layer for processing

#### Parameters

#### Events

#### Activities

### Archiving

### Raw data dissemination

### Operational messages dissemination

### UI Interface 

## Spacecraft M&C Driver

### TM support

### TC support

### Performance

## Getting Started

## Implement your driver
